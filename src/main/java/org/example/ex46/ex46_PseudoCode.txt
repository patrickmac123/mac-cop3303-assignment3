This program creates a histogram of words and
their frequencies from an input file

class WordCount
{
contains variables that help determine the words with
the highest count
and the number of count for each word

    public String high = null;
    public String middle = null;
    public String low = null;
    int b = 0;
    int m = 0;
    int s = 0;
}

checkVal(WordCount obj,String badger,String mushroom,String snake,int b,int m,int s)
{
This method helps determine which words have
the highest, middle, and lowest count
end
}

print(int n)
{
This method is used to help print out the histogram
by taking in the count for each word
end
}

Main:
Reads input from a file and uses a while loop to
continue reading until the file is empty

Creates an object obj to store the values of each word

A for loop is used to help split up the words
and for every occurrence of "badger", "mushroom",
and "snake" a count for each word.

The checkVal() method is called to help figure out which
words have the highest, middle, and lowest count

The histogram is then printed to console
